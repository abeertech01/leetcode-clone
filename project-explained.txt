Added Head in _app.tsx instead of index.tsx.
Included some necessary png images in the public directory
Change the favicon icon according to the favicon.png file in the public directory

Have src/components/Navbar/Navbar.tsx
Have boilerplate page of Auth page - pages/auth/index.tsx
Styling Navbar and placing it in auth page. Then place the slogan image in the auth page after navabr. 'pointer-events-none' and 'select-none' in the classes make sure that nobody can select or click to the image.

[3] = Auth Modal

                Login.tsx
                ResetPassword.tsx
                Signup.tsx
AuthModal design → place AuthModal in auth page after Navbar → div → AuthModal → Login component placed in AuthModal → Login form and styling → Signup component, almost like login component with few changes → ResetPassword component's UI
install recoil and make `atoms` directory in src directory - RecoilRoot in _app.tsx
src/
  atoms/
   authModalAtom.ts
In authModalAtom.ts state for auth modal has been placed.
In the same modal we are gonna have login, signup and resetPassword components by changing the type every time. So, we need a type variable in recoil state for three types: login, signup and forgotPassword. Configurig type in these components in a way so that we can change these types each time we need.
Made a closeModal hook and used it to close the auth modal. Here is an IMPORTANT NOTE and that is when we close the modal it needs to be type 'login'. So, we mention that in the close modal hook.

create youtube video modal from react-youtube npm package
Hydration failing error happened when implementing youtube video modal. It happened because of including div tags in tfoot tag. It turned out that div is allowed only in td tag for a table perspective. So I solved in that way.

Topbar's profile picture changes according to account and hovering over the profile picture gets a tooltip of email address.

Here at this stage we need to render all the problems in the workspace area.
In rendering the problems we are use SSG so that we can make it fast loading. In SSG the problems will be rendered in the building time. That's how it renders in lightening fast. 
It gave error because json had function which it can't get in. So made it string by toString()
