[1] = project setup
Install next.js app -> configure tailiwnd css -> add custom colors in tailwind config -> cleaning index.tsx with a fresh start with "Hello world" text.
Added Head in _app.tsx instead of index.tsx.

Styling Navbar and placing it in auth page. Then place the slogan image in the auth page after navabr. 'pointer-events-none' and 'select-none' in the classes make sure that nobody can select or click to the image.

components/
          Modals/
                AuthModal.tsx
                Login.tsx
                ResetPassword.tsx
                Signup.tsx
AuthModal design → place AuthModal in auth page after Navbar → div → AuthModal → Login component placed in AuthModal → Login form and styling → Signup component, almost like login component with few changes → ResetPassword component's UI
install recoil and make `atoms` directory in src directory - RecoilRoot in _app.tsx
src/
  atoms/
   authModalAtom.ts
In authModalAtom.ts state for auth modal has been placed.
In the same modal we are gonna have login, signup and resetPassword components by changing the type every time. So, we need a type variable in recoil state for three types: login, signup and forgotPassword. Configurig type in these components in a way so that we can change these types each time we need.
Made a closeModal hook and used it to close the auth modal. Here is an IMPORTANT NOTE and that is when we close the modal it needs to be type 'login'. So, we mention that in the close modal hook.

[4] - Firebase functionalities
src/
  firebase/
        firebase.ts
Creating a new project on firebase and placing the sdk private stuffs included with the help of env variables.
Optimization with next.js: if there is an app then getApp, otherwise initialize app.
installed an npm package called react-firebase-hooks. With the help of this package we get useCreateUserWithEmailAndPassword() hook and using this hook, making the signup process in signup component.
useSignInWithEmailAndPassword() hook is used to create sign in process like signup process.
To prevent user entering the auth page when already logged in, used useAuthState() hook and pageLoading useState.

implement problems table UI in home page
create youtube video modal from react-youtube npm package
Hydration failing error happened when implementing youtube video modal. It happened because of including div tags in tfoot tag. It turned out that div is allowed only in td tag for a table perspective. So I solved in that way.
